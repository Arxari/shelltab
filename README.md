### Do you miss your shell when browsing the web? Well no more!
Shelltab gives you a new tab that can look just like your shell and it doubles as a bookmark manager (trough an alias-like system) and search bar!

##### How to use?
You can either set this github page as your new tab or fork the repo and host your own GH page, all configs are stored locally in your browser cache

You can also use [New Tab Overide](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
After you downloaded the extension, download the shelltab.html, then open the extension settings of the new tab override, select 'local file' as option and put in the sheltab.html
