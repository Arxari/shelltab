### Do you miss your shell when browsing the web? Well no more!
Shelltab gives you a new tab that can look just like your shell and it doubles as a bookmark manager (trough an alias-like system) and search bar!

##### How to use?
You can set this github page as your new tab using [New Tab Overide](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/), you can also fork the repo and host your own GH page, all configs are stored locally in your browser cache

If you want to do it fully locally, you can download the index.html and use the [New Tab Overide](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) extension, in the extension settings select 'local file' as option and put in the index.html
###### Pro tip
In the New Tab Override settings click the checkbox next to "Set focus to the web page instead of the address bar"
